  <h1>Jason's Artwork</h1> 
    
    <h3>My vector image</h3>

    <p>It may have been a burst photo shoot but why did I make this expression? I use a version of this photo for all acounts where theres a photo with the username. HBO max,fantasy football etc. Theres me making that really dumb looking face. So I suppose I have a sense of humaor about myself. I used Illustrator and this was easy to do.</p>
<h3>Raster image</h3>
    <img src="images/jasonSheaSelfie1200px.png" alt="Jasons raster" width="600px">
    <p>I love Nature, Cats, Sneakers, videos games, Technology and my girlfriend. In that order. I don't like pictures of myself often. But that is a rare natural smile because I was at Niagra Falls, and nature is my greatest love. It was beautiful. So I figured good pic of my face, fantasic backdrop and it would be perfect canvas to display other things I love. This was done in Photoshop which I am decent in, so I feel good about how it turned out.</p>

    <h3>10 second Animation</h3>

    <p>My two kittens, Peyton (grey one) and Panda (black and white one). Panda cat is not the brightest bulb. She is very easily confused and turns her head upside when she is especially confused. So I thought it would be funny to see hear turning her head upside down while a fish and bird flip their whole bodies around. I used after effects which is new to me, I think it could have been better. But still find it funny and good enough for my first time using the app.</p>
    <h3>AI Podcast</h3>

    </audio>
    <p>A silly podcast about AI.
        This was partly meant to be funny, as I played the role of the interviewer while using a voice filter (AI) from Tik Tok as the 'expert', Dr.Spaceman being interviewed. It is also meant to be informative. As Dr.Spaceman is summarizing my feelings about AI and, it's meant to make the audience actually think about the subject and see it's importance. I used audacity to put it together. The most difficult part was the fact I hate the sound of my voice, and hearing over and over in editing was rough for me.
